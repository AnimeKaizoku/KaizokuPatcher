# KaizokuPatcher
A simple script to apply patches to AnimeKaizoku's eng sub encodes and update them to dual audio or fansub remuxer versions with the intended file names.

The xdelta3 binary is already included so it doesn't require any prior setup or installation, it's just one click to apply the patch.

Grab the executable from the release section.
